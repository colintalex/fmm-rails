# FindMyMarket

A personal project for fun, designed to exercise my curiousity of the week. Leverages my current map knowledge, while utilizing a larger dataset (10K records). Much of my map knowledge is locked away in secret at work, so this is a place for exploration within Rails/Leaflet.

# Setup

- Pull the repo to your computer.
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`
